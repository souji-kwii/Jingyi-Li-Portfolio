## The content
1. StoryPaws is a character-driven parent-child communication system built on “phygital physical-digital integration” and “object recognition + multimodal interaction”: Using proprietary IP character dolls as “storytelling companions and guides,” it identifies physical props and actions within the child's reach, collects spontaneous playtime utterances, analyzes children's psychological intent, and generates stylized storybooks; It simultaneously provides parents with story reviews and communication/developmental insights. The project has now completed a functional working prototype.
2. ThyroSync explores a novel care paradigm for thyroid cancer patients through the integration of personalized algorithms, non-invasive sensing, and hybrid wearable-portable interfaces.  By shifting from episodic treatment to continuous support, ThyroSync re-imagines the medical experience as an intelligent, ambient companion — always present, yet unobtrusive.  Beyond monitoring, the system fosters emotional resilience and helps reconstruct a positive narrative of living with long-term illness. ThyroSync has now reached the stage of software debugging, chip prototyping, and a small-scale trial production run of 100 units.
3. The WristFlow Pneumatic Rehabilitation project is designed for high-intensity mouse users such as esports athletes and long-term computer workers, focusing on chronic issues like carpal tunnel syndrome, tendonitis, and TFCC injuries. The project has now completed a functional working prototype.
